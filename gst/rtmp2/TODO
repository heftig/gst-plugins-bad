Some TODO items:

- connection timeouts don't cause an element error

- tcUrl is sent incorrectly.  Should not contain stream name.

- AMF parsing should be doing bounds checking

- rename chunk to message to match RTMP spec usage

- URL parsing neneds bounds checking

- rtmp2sink: Should look into reconnecting and resuming stream without
  deleting and recreating stream, which drops clients.

- Fix g_assert() usage

- Hook up meson build


Needed testing:

- AMF parsing

- connection closure by peer

- connection timeouts
