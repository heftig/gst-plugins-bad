Some TODO items:

- AMF parsing should be doing bounds checking

- rename chunk to message to match RTMP spec usage

- rtmp2sink: Should look into reconnecting and resuming stream without
  deleting and recreating stream, which drops clients.


Needed testing:

- AMF parsing

- connection closure by peer

- connection timeouts
